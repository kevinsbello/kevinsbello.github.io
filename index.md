<div class="section-block intro" markdown="1">
I am a Research Scientist at [Soroco](https://soroco.com/){:target="_blank"}, working on foundation models for interaction data. 
Previously, I was a [2021 Computing Innovation Fellow][cifellow]{:target="_blank"} and postdoctoral researcher jointly at [MLD@CMU][ml-cmu]{:target="_blank"} and [Chicago Booth][booth]{:target="_blank"}, where I worked with [Bryon Aragam][bryon]{:target="_blank"} and [Pradeep Ravikumar][pradeep]{:target="_blank"}.

I received my PhD in Computer Science from Purdue University, where I was advised by [Jean Honorio][jean]{:target="_blank"}.
Before my PhD, I completed my BSc in Mechatronics Engineering from the [National University of Engineering][uni]{:target="_blank"} in Lima, Peru.

### Research

My research goal is to develop next-generation ML systems that will tackle some of the current major challenges, such as robustness, interpretability, and fairness. 
These systems necessitate a shift from standard statistical models that are susceptible to capture undesired nonlinear correlations to ones that can potentially discover (causal) relations from multimodal, complex data.

**Topics of interest:**
- Causal machine learning: Structure learning, invariant/causal representations
- Generative models: Probabilistic models, latent variable modeling
- Statistical learning: Structured prediction, sample complexity, exact inference
