I am a [2021 Computing Innovation Fellow][cifellow]{:target="_blank"} and postdoctoral researcher in the
[Booth School of Business][booth]{:target="_blank"} at the [University of Chicago][uchicago]{:target="_blank"} and in the [Machine Learning Department][ml-cmu]{:target="_blank"} at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]{:target="_blank"}.
I am fortunate to be co-mentored by [Bryon Aragam][bryon]{:target="_blank"} and [Pradeep Ravikumar][pradeep]{:target="_blank"}.

I am broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
My research focuses on developing principled algorithms that are computationally and statistically efficient for various machine learning problems.
Current interests include structure learning (a.k.a., causal discovery), and learning invariant/causal representations.
Also, I have recently worked in structured prediction, studying efficient learning with latent variables ([NeurIPS'18][neurips18]{:target="_blank"}),
minimax bounds ([AISTATS'20][aistats20]{:target="_blank"}), and exact inference ([NeurIPS'19][neurips19]{:target="_blank"}, [NeurIPS'20][neurips20]{:target="_blank"}).

Previously, I received my PhD in Computer Science from Purdue University, where I was advised by [Jean Honorio][jean]{:target="_blank"}.
Before my PhD, I received a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering from the [National University of Engineering][uni]{:target="_blank"} in Lima, Peru.
