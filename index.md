I am a [2021 Computing Innovation Fellow][cifellow]{:target="_blank"} and postdoctoral researcher in the [Machine Learning Department][ml-cmu]{:target="_blank"} at [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu]{:target="_blank"} and in the [Booth School of Business][booth]{:target="_blank"} at the [University of Chicago][uchicago]{:target="_blank"}.
I am fortunate to be co-mentored by [Bryon Aragam][bryon]{:target="_blank"} and [Pradeep Ravikumar][pradeep]{:target="_blank"}.

Previously, I received my PhD in Computer Science from Purdue University, where I was advised by [Jean Honorio][jean]{:target="_blank"}.
Before my PhD, I completed my BSc in Mechatronics Engineering from the [National University of Engineering][uni]{:target="_blank"} in Lima, Peru.

I serve as Production Editor of the Journal of Machine Learning Research ([JMLR][jmlr]{:target="_blank"}), the flagship journal for the field of machine learning.
For JMLR related inquiries please reach out to [bello@jmlr.org](mailto:bello@jmlr.org).

### Research

My research goal is to develop next-generation ML systems that will tackle some of the current major challenges, such as robustness, interpretability, and fairness. 
These systems necessitate a shift from standard statistical models that are susceptible to capture undesired nonlinear correlations to ones that can potentially unearth causal relations from data. 
To this end, I develop, analyze, and apply principled algorithms for *causal ML*, with a focus on causal discovery ([NeurIPS'22][dagma], [ICML'23][topo], [NeurIPS'23][bivariate-notears]), which is a crucial step for developing the new wave of ML models, and learning invariant/causal representations ([NeurIPS'23][iscan]).

I also work in structured prediction, studying efficient learning with latent variables ([NeurIPS'18][neurips18]{:target="_blank"}),
minimax bounds ([AISTATS'20][aistats20]{:target="_blank"}), and exact inference ([NeurIPS'19][neurips19]{:target="_blank"}, [NeurIPS'20][neurips20]{:target="_blank"}).
