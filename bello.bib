  year={2024},
  abstract={Recent theoretical advances in unsupervised learning of causal representations guarantee the identifiability of latent causal graphs and mixing functions, given access to interventional data. However, current strong identifiability results hinge on hard single-node interventions, necessitating each latent variable's intervention in at least one context/environment, limiting practical applicability. This paper addresses scenarios with multiple datasets with the aim of uncovering the latent sources driving observed distribution changes, if any. In the setting of latent linear SEMs and linear mixing functions, we establish the identifiability of mechanism shifts in latent causal representations and provide an efficient algorithm based on independent component analysis to identify them. Crucially, our approach eliminates the need to estimate underlying causal graphs or shared mixing functions, significantly reducing both identifiability ambiguities and computational demands. Importantly, our method does not assume a consistent topological order of the latent causal graphs across different environments, allowing for varied types of interventions, including edge additions and reversals. Synthetic data experiments and a real-world application in psychometrics validate our contributions.},

  title={Identifying Causal Changes Between Linear Structural Equation Models},
  author={Vineet Malik and Kevin Bello and Asish Ghoshal and Jean Honorio},
  journal={Under Review},
  year={2024},
  abstract={In numerous scientific domains, it is crucial to learn the structures---commonly assumed to be directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)---of structural equation models (SEMs) from data as they are effective models for representing causal relationships among variables in a system. Nevertheless, in several scenarios, it is preferable to directly estimate the changes in causal relations between two distinct conditions. For example, estimating causal changes in genetic expression between healthy and diseased subjects can assist in isolating the genetic factors that contribute to the disease. This work studies the problem of directly estimating the structural difference between two linear SEMs, i.e. without estimating the individual DAG structures, given two sets of samples drawn from the individual SEMs. We consider general classes of linear SEMs where the noise distributions are allowed to be Gaussian or non-Gaussian and have different noise variances across the variables in the individual SEMs. We rigorously characterize novel conditions related to the topological layering of the structural difference that lead to the identifiability of the difference DAG (DDAG). Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify the DDAG via sequential re-estimation of the difference of precision matrices. A surprising implication of our results is that causal changes can be identifiable even between non-identifiable models such as Gaussian SEMs with unequal noise variances. Synthetic experiments are presented to validate our theoretical results and to show the scalability of our method.},

  abstract={Structural causal models (SCMs) are widely used in various disciplines to represent causal relationships among variables in complex systems. Unfortunately, the underlying causal structure is often unknown, and estimating it from data remains a challenging task. In many situations, however, the end goal is to localize the changes (shifts) in the causal mechanisms between related datasets instead of learning the full causal structure of the individual datasets. Some applications include root cause analysis, analyzing gene regulatory network structure changes between healthy and cancerous individuals, or explaining distribution shifts. This paper focuses on identifying the causal mechanism shifts in two or more related datasets over the same set of variablesâ€”without estimating the entire DAG structure of each SCM. Prior work under this setting assumed linear models with Gaussian noises; instead, in this work we assume that each SCM belongs to the more general class of nonlinear additive noise models (ANMs). A key technical contribution of this work is to show that the Jacobian of the score function for the mixture distribution allows for the identification of shifts under general non-parametric functional mechanisms. Once the shifted variables are identified, we leverage recent work to estimate the structural differences, if any, for the shifted variables. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data are provided to showcase the applicability of this approach.

  abstract = {Recently, an intriguing class of non-convex optimization problems has emerged in the context of learning directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). These problems involve minimizing a given loss or score function, subject to a non-convex continuous constraint that penalizes the presence of cycles in a graph. In this work, we delve into the optimality challenges associated with this class of non-convex programs. To address these challenges, we propose a bi-level algorithm that leverages the non-convex constraint in a novel way. The outer level of the algorithm optimizes over topological orders by iteratively swapping pairs of nodes within the topological order of a DAG. A key innovation of our approach is the development of an effective method for generating a set of candidate swapping pairs for each iteration. At the inner level, given a topological order, we utilize off-the-shelf solvers that can handle linear constraints. The key advantage of our proposed algorithm is that it is guaranteed to find a local minimum or a KKT point under weaker conditions compared to previous work and finds solutions with lower scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of achieving a better score. Additionally, our method can also be used as a post-processing algorithm to significantly improve the score of other algorithms.

  abstract={Understanding the complex mechanisms of the brain can be unraveled by extracting the Dynamic Effective Connectome (DEC). Recently, score-based Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) discovery methods have shown significant improvements in extracting the causal structure and inferring effective connectivity. However, learning DEC through these methods still faces two main challenges: one with the fundamental impotence of high-dimensional dynamic DAG discovery methods and the other with the low quality of fMRI data. In this paper, we introduce Bayesian Dynamic DAG learning with M-matrices Acyclicity characterization (BDyMA) method to address the challenges in discovering DEC. The presented dynamic causal model enables us to discover bidirected edges as well. Leveraging an unconstrained framework in the BDyMA method leads to more accurate results in detecting high-dimensional networks, achieving sparser outcomes, making it particularly suitable for extracting DEC. Additionally, the score function of the BDyMA method allows the incorporation of prior knowledge into the process of dynamic causal discovery which further enhances the accuracy of results. Comprehensive simulations on synthetic data and experiments on Human Connectome Project (HCP) data demonstrate that our method can handle both of the two main challenges, yielding more accurate and reliable DEC compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods. Additionally, we investigate the trustworthiness of DTI data as prior knowledge for DEC discovery and show the improvements in DEC discovery when the DTI data is incorporated into the process.},

  abstract={The combinatorial problem of learning directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from data was recently framed as a purely continuous optimization problem by leveraging a differentiable acyclicity characterization of DAGs based on the trace of a matrix exponential function. Existing acyclicity characterizations are based on the idea that powers of an adjacency matrix contain information about walks and cycles. In this work, we propose a new acyclicity characterization based on the log-determinant (log-det) function, which leverages the nilpotency property of DAGs. To deal with the inherent asymmetries of a DAG, we relate the domain of our log-det characterization to the set of M-matrices, which is a key difference to the classical log-det function defined over the cone of positive definite matrices. Similar to acyclicity functions previously proposed, our characterization is also exact and differentiable. However, when compared to existing characterizations, our log-det function: (1) Is better at detecting large cycles; (2) Has better-behaved gradients; and (3) Its runtime is in practice about an order of magnitude faster. From the optimization side, we drop the typically used augmented Lagrangian scheme and propose DAGMA (Directed Acyclic Graphs via M-matrices for Acyclicity), a method that resembles the central path for barrier methods. Each point in the central path of DAGMA is a solution to an unconstrained problem regularized by our log-det function, then we show that at the limit of the central path the solution is guaranteed to be a DAG. Finally, we provide extensive experiments for linear and nonlinear SEMs and show that our approach can reach large speedups and smaller structural Hamming distances against state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract={Performing inference in graphs is a common task within several machine learning problems, e.g., image segmentation, community detection, among others. For a given undirected connected graph, we tackle the statistical problem of exactly recovering an unknown ground-truth binary labeling of the nodes from a single corrupted observation of each edge. Such problem can be formulated as a quadratic combinatorial optimization problem over the boolean hypercube, where it has been shown before that one can (with high probability and in polynomial time) exactly recover the ground-truth labeling of graphs that have an isoperimetric number that grows with respect to the number of nodes (e.g., complete graphs, regular expanders). In this work, we apply a powerful hierarchy of relaxations, known as the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy, to the combinatorial problem. Motivated by empirical evidence on the improvement in exact recoverability, we center our attention on the degree-4 SoS relaxation and set out to understand the origin of such improvement from a graph theoretical perspective. We show that the solution of the dual of the relaxed problem is related to finding edge weights of the Johnson and Kneser graphs, where the weights fulfill the SoS constraints and intuitively allow the input graph to increase its algebraic connectivity. Finally, as byproduct of our analysis, we derive a novel Cheeger-type lower bound for the algebraic connectivity of graphs with signed edge weights.},

The focus of this paper is on the fundamental limits of exact recovery irrespective of computational efficiency, assuming the generative process proposed by Globerson et al. (2015). We derive the necessary condition for any algorithm and the sufficient condition for maximum likelihood estimation to achieve exact recovery with high probability, and reveal that the sufficient and necessary conditions are tight up to a logarithmic factor for a wide range of graphs. Finally, we show that there exists a gap between the fundamental limits and the performance of the computationally tractable method of Bello and Honorio (2019), which implies the need for further development of algorithms for exact inference.},

  abstract={Many inference problems in structured prediction can be modeled as maximizing a score function on a space of labels, where graphs are a natural representation to decompose the total score into a sum of unary (nodes) and pairwise (edges) scores. Given a generative model with an undirected connected graph G and true vector of binary labels $\bar{y}$, it has been previously shown that when G has good expansion properties, such as complete graphs or d-regular expanders, one can exactly recover $\bar{y}$ (with high probability and in polynomial time) from a single noisy observation of each edge and node. We analyze the previously studied generative model by Globerson et al. (2015) under a notion of statistical parity. That is, given a fair binary node labeling, we ask the question whether it is possible to recover the fair assignment, with high probability and in polynomial time, from single edge and node observations. We find that, in contrast to the known trade-offs between fairness and model performance, the addition of the fairness constraint improves the probability of exact recovery. We effectively explain this phenomenon and empirically show how graphs with poor expansion properties, such as grids, are now capable of achieving exact recovery. Finally, as a byproduct of our analysis, we provide a tighter minimum-eigenvalue bound than that which can be derived from Weyl's inequality.},

We also study the fundamental limits and show that any method requires at least $\Omega(d'\ log(\frac{p}{d'}))$ samples to learn difference SEMs with at most $d'$ parents per node.

The large-margin formulation including latent variables not only results in a non-convex formulation but also increases the search space by a factor of the size of the latent space. Recent work has proposed the use of the maximum loss over random structured outputs sampled independently from some proposal distribution, with theoretical guarantees. We extend this work by including latent variables. We study a new family of loss functions under Gaussian perturbations and analyze the effect of the latent space on the generalization bounds. We show that the non-convexity of learning with latent variables originates naturally, as it relates to a tight upper bound of the Gibbs decoder distortion with respect to the latent space. Finally, we provide a formulation using random samples and relaxations that produces a tighter upper bound of the Gibbs decoder distortion up to a statistical accuracy, which enables a polynomial time evaluation of the objective function. We illustrate the method with synthetic experiments and a computer vision application.},

In this paper we first propose a polynomial time algorithm for learning the exact correctly-oriented structure of the transitive reduction of any causal Bayesian network with high probability, by using interventional path queries. Each path query takes as input an origin node and a target node, and answers whether there is a directed path from the origin to the target. This is done by intervening on the origin node and observing samples from the target node. We theoretically show the logarithmic sample complexity for the size of interventional data per path query, for continuous and discrete networks. We then show how to learn the transitive edges using also logarithmic sample complexity (albeit in time exponential in the maximum number of parents for discrete networks), which allows us to learn the full network. We further extend our work by reducing the number of interventional path queries for learning rooted trees. We also provide an analysis of imperfect interventions.},
