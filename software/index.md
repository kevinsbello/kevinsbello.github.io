## Software

###### TOPO:
  Improved continuous constrained optimization for DAG structure learning with optimality guarantees. TOPO can be used with any loss function and includes implementations for both
  linear and nonlinear (e.g. neural network) models. [[Paper][topo_paper]{:target="_blank"} / [Code][topo_code]{:target="_blank"}]

###### DAGMA:
Faster and more accurate continuous constrained optimization for structure learning based on a new acyclicity 
characterization via the log-det function. DAGMA can be used with any loss function and includes implementations for both 
linear and nonlinear (e.g. neural network) models. [[Paper][dagma_paper]{:target="_blank"} / [Code][dagma_code]{:target="_blank"}]
