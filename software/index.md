## Software
- **DAGMA:**
Faster and more accurate continuous constrained optimization for structure learning based on a new acyclicity 
characterization via the log-det function. Can be used with any loss function and includes implementations for both 
linear and nonlinear (e.g. neural network) models. [[Paper][dagma_paper]{:target="_blank"} / [Code][dagma_code]{:target="_blank"}]
